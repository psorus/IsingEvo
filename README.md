Contains code for our Paper on ising based evolution.

evalu.py contains the main function optimized, and code to help with comparison.
It is used by various .py files, implementing different algorithms.

Notably is phase_search.py which represents the 2d Ising optimisation.

plot_{name}.py contain plotting scripts used in the paper. Some require running numpify.py and or simplify.py with save parts of the files in results/ to speed up the analysis.
